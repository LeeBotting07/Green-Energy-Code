        <h2>Discover the Power of Wind Turbines</h2>
        <p>Wind turbines are a clean, renewable source of energy that can help reduce your carbon footprint and save on energy costs. Investing in a wind turbine is a smart choice for a sustainable future.</p>
        <p>On average, a small wind turbine can generate enough electricity to power a single home, depending on wind conditions in your area. The cost of installing a wind turbine can range from $3,000 to $8,000 per kilowatt of capacity, but the long-term savings on energy bills and the environmental benefits make it a worthwhile investment.</p>
        <p>Wind turbines are not only cost-effective but also environmentally friendly. They produce no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, helping to combat climate change. Additionally, they require minimal maintenance and have a lifespan of 20-25 years, making them a reliable source of energy for decades.</p>
